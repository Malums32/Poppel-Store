# Poppel-Store
This is just an online ordering store for soft-drinks   
Based in the Western Cape, South Africa, Poppel is a candy and soft drink producer and importer.
Angus McClaren and Bertus Van Heerden founded the business in 2003. The company began attempting to reintroduce confectionary that has been popular for years.
In trying to do so, Poppel has faced a major challenge in the accounting system, the software it is using does not odder the essential capabilities they require to 
support the expansion on customer base (increasing their scalability approach). The other problem that it faces is the ordering approach/ method which will be addressed in this 
document as we will include designs that will work to accommodate this
